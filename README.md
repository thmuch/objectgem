# ObjectGEM

[ObjectGEM](https://snailshell.de/OGEM/) (OGEM) is an object-oriented framework (a collection of "unit"s or modules)
for [Pure Pascal](https://www.application-systems.de/purepascal/) on Atari TOS/GEM systems for GUI applications
including their complete workflow (lifecycle). It offers pre-built, extensible components like menus and toolbars,
modal and non-modal alert boxes and (tabbed) dialogs, easy handling of shortcuts (hotkeys), context sensitive
[help](https://github.com/thmuch/bubblegem) and integration of other applications via system messages (using the
[OLGA](https://snailshell.de/OLGA/index_e.html) protocol, for example).

The framework was heavily inspired by the [Object Windows Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Windows_Library).
I built ObjectGEM mainly to facilitate the development of my spreadsheet application [Texel](https://github.com/thmuch/texel),
but it is used in some other GEM applications as well.

ObjectGEM was developed and maintained from 1992 to 1999. Some milestones:
- 1.00 (1993-04-28)
- 1.10 (1994-03-03)
- 1.20 (1994-10-29). This was the latest "stable" version.
- 1.50 was "work in progress" over many years. I released beta versions from time to time; the latest "official" beta
  version dates back to [1999-03.05](https://snailshell.de/OGEM/). Afterwards, there were only minor changes on
  1999-04-29 which I released as recently as 2020, when I uploaded all the sources to GitHub.
